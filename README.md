-Problem Statement
Current methods for pneumonia detection rely heavily on manual interpretation
of chest X-ray images, leading to delays in diagnosis and potential errors. This
approach is inefficient, especially in busy healthcare settings, and may result in
missed diagnoses or delayed treatments.

-Solution
Our project proposes a streamlined solution leveraging advanced deep learning
techniques to automate pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. 
By developing a user-friendly software application integrated into existing healthcare
systems.
